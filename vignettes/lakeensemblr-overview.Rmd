# Included models

LakeEnsemblR currently includes the following models: GLM (@hipsey_general_2019),
FLake (@mironov_flake_2008), GOTM (@umlauf_gotm_2005),
Simstrat (@goudsmit_application_2002), and MyLake (@saloranta_mylakemulti_year_2007).

# Introduction
LakeEnsemblR is an R package that lets you run multiple one-dimensional physical lake models.

The settings for a model run are controlled by one centralised, "master" configuration file in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format. In this configuration file, you can set all the specifications for your model run, including start and end time, time steps, links to meteorological forcing and bathymetry files, etc. The package then converts these settings to the configuration files required by each model, through the `export_config` function. This sets up all models to run with the settings specified by the user, and the models are then run through the `run_ensemble` function. A netcdf file is created with the outputs of all the models, and the package provides functions to extract and plot this data.

Part of the design philosophy of LakeEnsemblR is that all input is given in a standardized format. This entails standard column names (which includes units), comma-separated ASCII files, and a DateTime format using the format `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`, for example `2020-04-03 09:00:00`. In this document, we will explain what the required files are and in what format they need to be. We also advise you to look at the provided example files, and at the templates provided with the R package (to be found in `package/inst/extdata`, or extracted by the function `get_template`).

# Installation
The code of LakeEnsemblR is hosted on the AEMON-J Github page (https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR), and can be installed using the `devtools` package
```{}
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR)
```

The package relies on multiple other packages that also need to be installed. Most notably, to run the multiple models, it requires the packages FLakeR, GLM3r, GOTMr, SimstratR, and MyLakeR. These packages run the individual models, and contain ways of running the models for the platforms Windows, MacOS, or Linux, through either executables, or by having the model code in R. 

# The LakeEnsemblR configuration file
In this section, we go through the LakeEnsemblR configuration file. This file controls the settings with which the models are run. It is written in [YAML](https://yaml.org/) (Yaml Ain't Markup Language) format, and can be opened by text-editors such as Notepad or Notepad++. Although not needed to use LakeEnsemblR, you can read this file into R with the `configr` package (`read.config` function). Within LakeEnsemblR, we provide the `get_yaml_multiple` and `input_yaml_multiple` functions to get and input values into this file type.

There is an LakeEnsemblR configuration file provided in the example dataset in the package (`LakeEnsemblR::get_template("LakeEnsemblR_config")`) or you can download a copy from GitHub [here](https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR/blob/main/inst/extdata/feeagh/LakeEnsemblR.yaml).

## Location
The first section is "Location". Here you specify the name, latitude and longitude, elevation, maximum depth, and initial depth.

You also need to provide a link to the hypsograph (i.e. surface area per depth) file. As in the rest of the configuration file, all links to files are relative to the `folder` argument in the LakeEnsemblR (from now on: LER) functions (default is the R working directory). We strongly advise to set the working directory to the location of the LER config file, and link to the files relative to this directory (we explain this further in the chapter "Workflow" of this vignette). For example, if your hypsograph file is called `hypsograph.csv` and in the same folder as the LER config file, the corresponding line in the LER config file would look like
```{yaml}
  hypsograph: hypsograph.csv
```

The data needs to be a comma-separated file (.csv) where 0m is the surface and all depths are reported as positive, in meters. Area needs to be in meters squared. The column names *must* be `Depth_meter` and `Area_meterSquared`

Example of data:
```{csv}
Depth_meter,Area_meterSquared
0,3931000
1,3688025
2,3445050
3,3336093.492
4,3225992.455
5,3133491.11
6,3029720
...
```

## Time
In the "Time" section, you fill in the start and end date of the simulation, and the model time step. `time_step` indicates the model integration time step, i.e. each time step that the model performs a calculation. 

LakeEnsemblR will work with any time zone, provided that the time columns in all input files are in the same time zone and there are no shifts from/to daylight saving time in the files. Of all models, only GLM requires to know the time zone. In LakeEnsemblR this is automatically set to UTC. However, this information is only used in GLM's `albedo_mode` 2 and 3, or when GLM's `rad_mode` is set to 5 (i.e. computing shortwave radiation if this is not provided). In LakeEnsemblR, the default `albedo_mode` is 1, and shortwave radiation must be provided, so providing the timezone is not required. Yet if you are changing `albedo_mode` to 2 or 3, make sure you enter your data in UTC. GOTM also assumes the time to be in UTC, but this is only used when computing shortwave radiation if it is not provided, which does not happen when using LakeEnsemblR.

## Config files
In this section, you link to the model-specific configuration files. Templates of these can be found in in the package (`get_template("FLake_config")`, `get_template("GLM_config")`, etc. all available templates can be shown using `get_template()`) or you can download a copy from GitHub [here](https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR/blob/main/inst/extdata). The setup of LakeEnsemblR is such that you will usually not have to access these files, as most settings are regulated through the LER "main" config file. However, should you want to change some of the more specialised settings in each model, that is possible.

## Observations
If you have observations of water temperature, ice cover or water level, you can fill them in here. These will be used in plotting, and in case of water temperature potentially in initialising the temperature profile at the start of the simulation (see next section). 

For water temperature, the data needs to be a comma separated values (.csv) file where the datetime column is in the format `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`. Depths are positive and relative to the water surface. Water temperature is in degrees Celsius. The column names *must* be `datetime`, `Depth_meter` and `Water_Temperature_celsius` (templates available).

Example of data:
```{csv}
datetime,Depth_meter,Water_Temperature_celsius
2004-01-05 00:00:00,0.9,6.97
2004-01-06 00:00:00,2.5,6.71
2004-01-07 00:00:00,5,6.73
2004-01-08 00:00:00,8,6.76
...
```


For ice height, the data must also be a comma separated values (.csv) file, with datetime column in format `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS` and has the column name `datetime`. Ice height must be provided in meters and the column must be named `Ice_Height_meter`.

Example of data:

```{csv}
datetime, Ice_Height_meter
2004-01-01 00:00:00,0.3
2004-01-02 00:00:00,0.3
2004-01-03 00:00:00,0.35
...
```

For water level, the data must also be a comma seperated values (.csv) file, with datetime column in format `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS` and has the column name `datetime`. Water level must be provided in meters above ground and the column must be named `Water_Level_meter`.

Example of data:

```{csv}
datetime, Water_Level_meter
2004-01-01 00:00:00,45.4
2004-01-02 00:00:00,45.6
2004-01-03 00:00:00,45.7
...
```

## Input
In the "Input" section, you give information about the initial temperature profile, meteorological forcing, the light extinction coefficient, and whether the ice modules should be used.

Firstly, you can give the initial temperature profile with which to start the simulation (link to .csv file with headers `Depth_meter, Water_Temperature_celsius`, template available using `get_template("Initial temperature profile")`). If you leave it empty, the water temperature observations will be used, provided you have an observation on the starting time of your simulation.

Secondly, you give the link to the file with your meteorological data. The data needs to be a comma separated values (.csv) file where the datetime column is in the format `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`. See Table 1 for the list of variables, units and column names. The `time_zone` setting has not been implemented yet.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# for html
x_html <- kable(met_input, caption = paste0("Table 1. Description of meteorological variables used ",
                                          "within LakeEnsemblR with units and required ",
                                          "column names."), row.names = FALSE, format = "html")
kable_styling(x_html, position = "left", font_size = 11)

# # for pdf
# x_latex <- xtable(met_input, caption = paste0("Description of meteorological variables used ",
#                                           "within LakeEnsemblR with units and required ",
#                                           "column names."), format = "latex",
#                   align = c("p{0cm}", "p{2.4cm}", "p{0.6cm}", "p{6.5cm}", "p{5.cm}"))
# print(x_latex, size = "\\tiny", include.rownames = FALSE )

```


Next you can either give a value for Kw (light extinction coefficient) in 1/m, or give the link to a file, where you can vary Kw over time (template available using `get_template("Light extinction")`). The file must be a comma-separated file (.csv) with the two columns `datetime` and 	`Extinction_Coefficient_perMeter` containing the date in the format (`YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`) and corresponding Kw value in 1/m.


Lastly, you can specify if you want to use the ice modules that are present in some of the models. 

## Inflows
Specify if you want to add inflows to your simulation. If yes, you need to link to a file with the inflow data. The data needs to be a comma separated values (.csv) file where the datetime column is in the format `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`. Flow discharge, water temperature, and salinity need to be specified. The column names *must* be `datetime`, `Flow_metersCubedPerSecond`, `Water_Temperature_celsius`, and `Salinity_practicalSalinityUnits` (template available using `get_template("Inflow")` ). If you have multiple inflows, you should add suffixes "_1", "_2", etc. The fix_wlvl argument lets you fix the water level in the GOTM model, to reproduce the behaviour of an earlier version of LakeEnsemblR. 

Example of inflow data:
```{csv}
datetime,Flow_metersCubedPerSecond,Water_Temperature_celsius,Salinity_practicalSalinityUnits
2005-01-01 00:00:00,5.62,6.96,0.00
2005-01-02 00:00:00,2.32,6.00,0.00
2005-01-03 00:00:00,1.77,8.44,0.00
2005-01-04 00:00:00,4.64,7.27,0.00
...
```

## Outflows

For the models that allow changing water level (at this moment GLM, GOTM, Simstrat) outflows can be set in this section by setting `use` to true. The outflow discharge must be provided in daily resolution in a .csv file specified by `file`. The file must contain a date column in `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS` format called `datetime` and for every outflow (specified by `number_outflows`) one column titled `Flow_metersCubedPerSecond`, if more than one outflow are defined the outflow columns need to be numbered like this: `Flow_metersCubedPerSecond_1`, `Flow_metersCubedPerSecond_2`. For each outflow the depth of the outflow must be specified as height in meters above the lake bottom, or if the outflow is a surface outflow it can be set to "-1".


```{yaml}
outflows:
   use: true                                    # use outflows? [true/false]
   file: LakeEnsemblR_outflow_standard.csv      # file with outflow data
   number_outflows: 2                           # number of outflows in the outflow file
   outflow_lvl:                                 # height of the outflow above the ground.
      - -1
      - 15
```


## Output
In the "Output" section, you specify how the output should look like. This can be "netcdf" or "text", which will generate a series of csv files in rLakeAnalyzer format. You can specify the depth interval of the output, and the frequency. Also specify what variables should be in the output (currently "temp", "ice_height", "salt", "dens", and "w_level").

<!-- ## Biogeochemistry -->
<!-- Currently not implemented -->

## Scaling factors

In the "Scaling factors" (scaling_factors) section scaling factors to be applied to meteorological input as well as to inflows and outflows, either for all models or model-specific can be defined. If the section is not specified, no scaling is applied. Using "all" scaling factors that should be applied to all models can be defined, otherwise model specific scaling can be supplied by using the model name. If both "all" and model-specific are specified for a certain model, only the model-specific scaling is applied. If there are multiple inflows or outflows a list of scaling parameters for each of them must be provided (see example).

```{yaml}
scaling_factors:
   all:
      wind_speed: 1.0
      swr: 1.0
   Simstrat:
      wind_speed: 0.95
   GLM:
     outflow:
      - 1.02
      - 1.03
```


## Model parameters
All models in LakeEnsemblR have different parameterisations. In this section, you can set the value of any parameter in one of the model-specific configuration files. 

You can give either only the name of the parameter, but if needed you can also provide the name of the section in which the parameter occurs, separated by a `/`. For example for GOTM's k_min parameter:
```{yaml}
  GOTM:
    k_min: 3.6E-6
```
or:
```{yaml}
  GOTM:
    turb_param/k_min: 3.6E-6
```

## Calibration
This section is used when calibrating the models. In the package, the `cali_ensemble` function runs the calibration. For all three methods model specific parameters and scaling factors for the input meteorological forcing can be calibrated. In any case the parameters to be calibrated are definded in the master control .yaml file. The meteo scalings are defined in the `met:` section and the model specific parameters in sections with the corresponding model names e.g. `MyLake:`. The meteo scaling names must be the short names for the meteo variables, which are defined in the `met_var_dic` data and can be inspected using `print(met_var_dic)`. The model specific names must be the parameter name as given in the model specific configuration file (e.g. gotm.yaml) combined with the lowest section name in which the parameter can be found and separated by a slash "/" (e.g. turb_param/k_min). An example of how the calibration section could look like is given below:

```{yaml}
calibration:                                   # Calibration section                                   # Calibration section
   met:                                        # Meteo scaling parameter
      wind_speed:                              # Wind speed scaling
         lower: 0.5                            # lower bound for wind speed scaling        
         upper: 2                              # upper bound for wind speed scaling
         initial: 1                            # initial value for wind speed scaling
         log: false                            # log transform scaling factor
      swr:                                     # shortwave radiation scaling

```
 An example on how to run the calibration  see section 5.7 "Model calibration". 

# Workflow
In this chapter, we quickly show you how your workflow with LakeEnsemblR could look like. 

## Setting up a directory
First, you make an empty directory for the simulations of a specific lake. In this directory, you place the LakeEnsemblR configuration file, and the necessary LakeEnsemblR-format input files (e.g. meteorology, inflow, water temperature observations, hypsograph). Within this directory, you create empty folders for each model (FLake, GLM, GOTM, Simstrat, MyLake), and in here you place the model-specific configuration files, corresponding the information you put in the `config_files` section in the LER config file. 

## Export_config
Then, you run the `export_config` function, which exports the settings in the LER configuration file to the model-specific configuration files. It is possible to run parts of this function, such as `export_meteo`, if the meteorological forcing is the only thing you changed, but usually you will run `export_config`.

## Optional: changes in model-specific directories
Optionally, you can now go into the model-specific configuration files and make further changes. This should not be needed for regular simulations, especially since you can control parameters in the `model_parameters` section of the LER config file, but the option is there. For example, if you want to change the depth of the inflow in the Simstrat model, you could go to the Simstrat folders and make these changes manually (or through a script you wrote). It speaks for itself that these changes should be done only if you are sure this is what you need, and LakeEnsemblR does not provide further support for this.

## Run_ensemble
The next step would be to call `run_ensemble`, which runs all the models. A new folder called "output" is created, in which a netcdf-file will be put with all the results from the model runs. If you are interested, each model sub-folder will also have an "output" folder, with the model-specific model output.

## Example model run
See below for an example run, and some post-processing of the data.
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install packages - Ensure all packages are up to date
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/GLM3r", ref = "v3.1.1")
devtools::install_github("USGS-R/glmtools", ref = "ggplot_overhaul")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/FLakeR", ref = "inflow")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/GOTMr")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/gotmtools")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/SimstratR")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/MyLakeR")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR")

# Load libraries
library(LakeEnsemblR)
library(ggplot2)

# Set working directory with example data from Lough Feeagh, Ireland
template_folder <- system.file("extdata/feeagh", package= "LakeEnsemblR")
dir.create("example") # Create example folder
file.copy(from = template_folder, to = "example", recursive = TRUE)
setwd("example/feeagh") # Change working directory to example folder

# Set models & config file
model <- c("GLM",  "FLake", "GOTM", "Simstrat", "MyLake")
config_file <- "LakeEnsemblR.yaml"

# 1. Example - creates directories with all model setup
export_config(config_file = config_file, model = model, folder = ".")


# 2. Run ensemble lake models
wtemp_list <- run_ensemble(config_file = config_file,
                           model = c("FLake", "GLM", "GOTM", "Simstrat", "MyLake"),
                           return_list = TRUE)

```

Plotting the model outputs is very easy using the `plot_heatmap()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE}

g1 <- plot_heatmap("output/ensemble_output.nc")

ggsave("output/model_ensemble_watertemp.png", g1,  dpi = 300,width = 384,height = 300,
       units = "mm")

```

## Post-processing

Once LakeEnsemblR did successfully run all lake models, you can either extract the output data from the netcdf file for custom analysis and plotting, or use post-processing scripts for an initial look at the output.

### Quick post-processing
Now that the model simulations are finished, you can extract the data with `load_var`, or plot it with `plot_ensemble`. You can extract data from the netcdf file to do any further analysis. The `ncdf4` R package supports working with netcdf data in R, and the PyNcView software (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyncview/) can be used to look at netcdf output.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# Import the LER output into your workspace
ens_out <- "output/ensemble_output.nc"

# Plot depth and time-specific results
p <- plot_ensemble(ncdf = ens_out, model = c("FLake", "GLM",  "GOTM", "Simstrat", "MyLake"),
                   depth = 0.9, var = "temp",
                   boxwhisker = TRUE, residuals = TRUE)
```

```{r metrics, eval = FALSE}

         var = "temp")

### Adding several model runs to a single netcdf file

The `run_ensemble` function allows to add different model runs to a single netcdf file.
This is done by setting the argument `add = TRUE`. Only model runs that go over the same
time period and use the same time steps can be combined to a single netcdf file. Using this
functionality e.g. model runs with different parametrizations can be ran and compared. Many
diagnostic functions like `calc_fit` or `plot_ensemble` have two additional arguments `dim`
and `dim_index` to select which dimension should be used. The argument `dim` can either be
"model" or "member" and `dim_index` then gives the index of the other dimension to be used, e.g.
if the netcdf file contains 3 different ensemble runs (member) with the two models "FLake" and
"GLM" `calc_fit("ncfile.nc", model = c("FLake", "GLM"), dim = "model", dim_index = 2)` calculates
the model performance of both model for the second ensemble run (`dim_index = 2`). Whereas,  
`calc_fit("ncfile.nc", model = c("FLake", "GLM"), dim = "member", dim_index = 2)` calculates
the performance of all model runs (members) of the GLM runs (the second model).

## Model calibration

LakeEnsemblR includes some tools for automatic model calibration which are included in the `cali_ensemble()` function. The function profides three methods:

 - method "LHC": Lathin hypercube calibration
 - method "MCMC": Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation using the `modMCMC` function from the `FME` package (@soetaert_inverse_2010)
 - method "modFit": model fitting using one of the algorithms provided in the `modFit` function from the `FME` package (@soetaert_inverse_2010)

For details on the structure of the calibration section in the yaml config file see section 4.11.

```


The calibration process can then be run using the `cali_ensemble()` function. Methods "LHC" and "MCMC" will write intermediate results to .csv text files in the folder specified by the `out_f` argument. It is possible to parallelize the calibration procedure using the `parallel` argument. This will distribute the calibration of the models to different cores. It is worth noting that in the current state the bottle neck for the computation speed is running MyLake (as it is written in R and significantly slower than the other four models).

You can calibrate any parameter you like. However, as a guideline for users that are not familiar with some of these models, here are some model-specific parameters that have been calibrated in previous studies:

 - FLake: depth_w_lk, extincoef_optic, c_relax_C, fetch_lk, latitude_lk, depth_bs_lk, T_bs_lk, albedo, initial conditions (@salgado_2010) (@bernhardt_2012) (@layden_2016)
 - GLM: meteorological scaling factors (wind_factor, sw_factor, lw_factor), strmbd_slope, Kw, min_layer_thick, max_layer_thick, coef_mix_conv, coef_wind_stir, coef_mix_shear, coef_mix_turb, coef_mix_KH, coef_mix_hyp (@bueche_2017) (@bruce_mlca_glm_2018) (@hipsey_general_2019) 
 - GOTM: Scaling factors for heat, wind speed, and shortwave radiation, k_min, g2 (@ayala_simulations_gotm_2020)
 - Simstrat: a_seiche, f_wind, p_radin, p_albedo, q_nn, c10, cd (peeters_2002) (@gaudard_toward_2019)
 - MyLake: (Physical parameters only:) C_shelter, swa_b1 (Less sensitive: dz and I_scT, and Kz_ak) (@saloranta_2006)
 
### LHC method

The "LHC" method will sample a number of parameter sets definded by the `num` argument within the bounds definded by `upper` and `lower` in the master config file. For each model given in the `model` argument a set of parameters consisting of the meteo scaling factors and the model spüecific parameters will be sampled and the model will be run for each set, calculating model performance indices for each run. Both the parameter set and the model results will be written to the `out_f` folder. By default the model performance indices are:

 - rmse: root mean squared error
 - nse: Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency
 - r: Pearson corelation coefficient
 - bias: the mean error
 - nmae: normalized mean absolute error
 
But you can provide your own function to calculate model performances using the `qualfun` argument. The provided function must take the two arguments: observed data, and simulated data, both are data.frames with first column being datetime and then columns with depth specific values (lokking like the return value of the `get_output()` function).

The function returns a list with an entry for every model, containing the path to the files containing the parameter sets and the model performance indices for every model run.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# calibrate the 
cali_ensemble(config_file, model = c("GLM", "GOTM", "FLake", "MyLake", "Simstrat"),
              cmethod = "LHC", num = 300, out_f = "calibration")

```

### MCMC method

The "MCMC" method utalizes the `modMCMC()` function from the `FME` package (@soetaert_inverse_2010), using an adaptive Metropolis algorithm and including a delayed rejection procedure. Internally the function calculates the sum of squares, which is equivalent to -2 log(likelihood) for a Gaussian likelihood and prior. The MCMC will run `num` evaluations for every model. The outcome of every model call during the MCMC simulation is written to a model specific file in the `out_f` folder, containing the parameter values and the sum of squares of the residuals. Additional arguments can be supplied to `modMCMC()` using the ellipsis argument (`...`).

The function returns a list with an entry for every model, containing the return value of `modMCMC()` for every model run. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# calibrate the 
cali_ensemble(config_file, model = c("GLM", "GOTM", "FLake", "MyLake", "Simstrat"),
              cmethod = "MCMC", num = 3000, out_f = "calibration")

```

### modFit method

The "modFit" method utalizes the `modFit()` function from the `FME` package (@soetaert_inverse_2010), Fitting a model to data. Additional arguments can be supplied to `modFit()` using the ellipsis argument (`...`).

The function returns a list with an entry for every model, containing the return value of `modFit()` for every model run. 

```{r eval = FALSE}
# calibrate the models using a Nelder-Mead algorithm
cali_ensemble(config_file, model = c("GLM", "GOTM", "FLake", "MyLake", "Simstrat"),
              cmethod = "modFit", out_f = "calibration", method = "Nelder-Mead")

```
