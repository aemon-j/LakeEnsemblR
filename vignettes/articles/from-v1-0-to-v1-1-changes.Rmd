## Version 1.1

In March 2022, we updated LakeEnsemblR to version 1.1. The main advantage of this new version is the possibility to use multiple inflows and outflows at specified depths in your simulated lake or reservoir. Moreover, these inflows and outflows no longer have to balance each other out, and in the models that support this (Simstrat, GLM, GOTM) you can therefore now also simulate varying water levels. Simstrat has been updated to a later version (v3.0.1) and there have been other bug fixes as well, for example regarding plotting heatmaps in lakes with varying water level, or in the YAML-parser functions.

However, some of these improvements required a change in the configuration file, which may cause unexpected errors when updating LakeEnsemblR to v1.1. Here we describe how to avoid or fix these problems, and we also give instructions on how you can keep working with v1.0, if you prefer this.

As a general advice, please first reinstall the latest versions of the model-specific packages (GLM3r, SimstratR, etc.) after updating LakeEnsemblR. Also, new example test cases and configuration files are provided in LakeEnsemblR, the model-specific packages, and at the [LER_examples Github page](https://github.com/aemon-j/LER_examples). The advice below is therefore mostly if you want to adapt your existing setup to v1.1.

### Changes in the LakeEnsemblR configuration file

##### inflows and outflows sections

In v1.0, there was a single <em>inflows</em> section, but now inflows and outflows are split into two sections.

-   "use": Each section has the "use" argument; if set to "false", no inflows or outflows are used and the rest of the section is not read.
-   "file": If use = true, provide the file where inflow discharge, temperature, and salinity, or outflow discharge are provided. Note that multiple flows can be provided in this file, by adding the suffixes "\_1", "\_2", "\_3", etc. See <code>get_template("Inflow")</code> for an example inflow file with two inflows, or <code>get_template("Outflow")</code> for an example outflow file with a single outflow.
-   "number_inflows" and "number_outflows": The number of inflows or outflows to use.
-   "outflow_lvl" (<em>outflows</em>-only): The height of the outflows, relative to the deepest point in the lake. If the outflow is a surface outflow use "-1". If there are more than one outflow in the outflow file, this must be a list with one value per outflow, e.g.:

```         
outflow_lvl:
  - -1
  - 10
```

-   Inflows are always assumed to be surface inflows.
-   "fix_wlvl" (<em>inflows</em>-only and optional): If set to "true", the water level in GOTM will be fixed to the initial water level. This reproduces v1.0 behaviour. However, note that this means that the water balance is no longer correctly resolved in GOTM. If this argument is absent, it is assumed to be "false".

Note that the "mass_balance" argument from v1.0 is no longer used. If you want to recreate the situation of v1.0 where inflow = outflow, you can just provide the same file name in the "file" argument of both the inflows and outflows section. Also the "scale_param" parameter from the v1.0 <em>inflows</em> section has been (re)moved (see next paragraph).

#### Inflow and outflow scaling factors

If you want to scale the discharge in your inflows or outflows (for example if your measured streamflow only accounts for part of the catchment runoff), you need to put this in the <em>scaling_factors</em> section. It's important to note that you need to provide multiple scaling factors if you have multiple inflows or outflows, in a list-format. As with other scaling factors, model-specific scaling factors overwrite generic ("all") scaling factors. Here is an example for a reservoir with a single inflow and two outflows, in which the first (surface) outflow in Simstrat has a 10% higher discharge:

```         
scaling_factors:
   all:
      inflow: 1.0
      outflow:
      - 1.0
      - 1.0
   Simstrat:
      outflow:
      - 1.1
      - 1.0
```

#### The **output** section

This section has remained largely the same, but with two small updates. The most important one is that "w_level" is now a potential output of the models, to be listed under "variables". Note that for MyLake and FLake, this is set to `NA`, because these models do not simulate water level, although you can assume water level in these models to be equal to the model parameters `In.Z` and`depth_w_lk`, respectively.

A second update is that you can provide "max_members", which is the maximum number of members that you can add to the same netcdf file using the `add = TRUE` argument in `run_ensemble()`. If it is not provided, it is assumed to be 25.

### Changes in the Simstrat configuration file

A new version of Simstrat is being used (v3.0.1), which included some changes in the names of parameters. The easiest solution to this problem will be to remove your simstrat.par file and run export_config() again, which will create a new file based on the template in SimstratR. If you want to make the changes manually: \* p_albedo -\> p_sw_ice \* p_sw -\> p_sw_water \* InflowPlacement -\> InflowMode. However, also the options changed: Old 0 = New 1, Old 1 = New 2, New 0 = no inflows or outflows used.

### How do the different models handle the water balance?

If you use inflows and outflows of different intensity and then look at the "w_level" output of LakeEnsemblR, you will probably notice that each model handles the water balance differently. Here we quickly mention the differences. These differences are inherent to the models, and LakeEnsemblR does not attempt to standardise this. However, if you want to create a similar water level between the models, you could for example change the scaling factors of the inflow or the outflow.

-   FLake: There is no water balance, as only the heat transferred by the inflow is added to the model. w_level output is therefore "NA".
-   GLM: **water balance = delta-discharge + precipitation + evaporation + overflow**
-   GOTM: **water balance = delta-discharge + precipitation + evaporation**
-   Simstrat: **water balance = delta-discharge + overflow**
-   MyLake: Outflow discharge is assumed to be equal to the inflow discharge, and no other flows are computed. w_level output is therefore "NA".

With "overflow" we mean that if the water level exceeds the highest level in the hypsograph, the excess water is removed from the model.

In GOTM, there are also other options of computing the water balance, for example by forcing the water level to a prescribed time series. These options are not supported by LakeEnsemblR, but can still be used by accessing the gotm.yaml file.

### What if I want to keep working with v1.0?

Perhaps you have already set up LakeEnsemblR v1.0 in your lake or reservoir, and you don't want this update to affect your simulations. Because LakeEnsemblR and the model-specific packages have been attached to a specific "release" in GitHub, you can still install these old versions. These are the versions that are described in the publication Moore et al. (2021), and you will still be able to use your old workflow.

```         
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR@v1.0.0")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/FLakeR@LakeEnsemblR_v1.0.0")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/GLM3r@LakeEnsemblR_v1.0.0")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/GOTMr@LakeEnsemblR_v1.0.0")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/SimstratR@LakeEnsemblR_v1.0.0")
devtools::install_github("aemon-j/MyLakeR@LakeEnsemblR_v1.0.0")
```

To access the LER_examples corresponding to v1.0 of LakeEnsemblR, download [this zip file](https://github.com/aemon-j/LER_examples/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

Alternatively, you can install v1.1 and the new model-specific packages, change your configuration file as described above, set the outflow file to the same file as the inflow file, and "fix_wlvl" to "true". This should result in very similar behaviour compared to v1.0 (although a later version of the Simstrat model will be used).
